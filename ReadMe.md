# Imperial Assault Skirmish Map Project

[New Orders](https://neworders.xyz) and [Board Wars](http://boardwars.eu/) podcasts are working together to bring you the Imperial Assault Skirmish Map Project. The project continues the lovely work started by Ibsh to create beautiful images for every Imperial Assault Skirmish Map. These maps serve two purposes:

1. Skirmish maps have been added to the Boardwars.eu [Imperial Assault Image DB](http://cards.boardwars.eu/index.php?album=Skirmish-Maps) where they can be searched and referenced.
2. Printable map groups are available for the current Imperial Assault tournament rotation as well as a full download of all the maps for printing.

*To use these maps you must own the indicated Fantasy Flight Games product.*

### Printing
These maps are created at 300 DPI so they can be easily printed at full size to make functional playmats.
![playmat photo](web_images/map-sample.jpg)

* **The most popular printouts:** [All currently available maps](https://github.com/nickv2002/Imperial-Assault-Skirmish-Map-Project/tree/master/Combined_IA_Map_Sheets/All2PlayerMaps) or [the current tournament maps](https://github.com/nickv2002/Imperial-Assault-Skirmish-Map-Project/tree/master/Combined_IA_Map_Sheets/TournamentRotationUscruTarkinLothal) (*Uscru Entertainment District*, *Tarkin Initiative Labs*, & *Lothal Wastes*).
* There is also a [printable map set for each wave](https://github.com/nickv2002/Imperial-Assault-Skirmish-Map-Project/tree/master/Combined_IA_Map_Sheets).
* Finally, individual maps can be printed by downloading the 300 DPI **Print Versions** linked in the table above (with '&rarr;') and submitting that to Printi (after converting to PDF). To calculate the print dimensions in inches: divide the horizontal and vertical pixels by 300.
* Recommended shop & product: [Printi PVC Banners](https://www.printi.com/pvc-banners)
* Printi charges by the area of your print but there is a minimum charge that's about equal to 1 or 2 maps, so you might as well order a few at once to save on the cost per map. It's also much cheaper to choose the slowest delivery time on the order page.
* The JPG & PDF files are very large so some people have trouble seeing them on their computer. Give them some time if you have an older computer.

### Background & Colophon
This project was started by Ibsh and popularized on [this FFG Thread](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186906-pre-assembled-skirmish-maps/). After Ibsh stepped away, he kindly passed the source files on Nick (nickv2002 on the forums and one of the hosts of the [New Orders podcast](https://neworders.xyz/)). Nick worked with Stephan at [Boardwars.eu](http://boardwars.eu/) to integrate with their [Imperial Assault Image DB](http://cards.boardwars.eu/).

In addition to making high resolution maps, much care has gone into cleaning up these map images. The seams between tiles have been removed, but you’ll also find altered wording for clearer mission rules and some other subtle tweaks that we think improves the maps.

### Frequently Asked Questions
* **How can I create some other mix of printable maps?** [Groups for each wave and all the tournament rotations been pre-generated](https://github.com/nickv2002/Imperial-Assault-Skirmish-Map-Project/tree/master/Combined_IA_Map_Sheets). Otherwise, the source code & files are all available as part of this GitHub project: download the project and edit the Python script to create a group you'd like to print (Wannabepudge has made a [guide to help](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/253553-imperial-assault-printable-skirmish-map-project/?do=findComment&comment=2960950)).
* **Who’s credited for making these maps?** *Jabba's Palace* and maps predating *Jabba’s Realm* were made by Ibsh. Other were made by Nick by combining scans from Ibsh’s & Leacher with tile-retouching from Stephan, EvadGonzo, Oslatir, Paul Windram, Lorunks, and Fabiofotomoto.
* **I found an mistake in the maps.** Please double check with the rules and original map insert. After confirming, please [Create an Issue](https://github.com/nickv2002/Imperial-Assault-Skirmish-Map-Project/issues/new) on GitHub or let Nick know at the contact info below.
* **How can I help** If you're good with image-editing, please get in touch before you create anything so we can share resources and avoid duplicating work accidentally. We'll need lots of help to finish the rest of the *Heart of the Empire* maps and there's lots to do to improve the quality of existing tile scans.

### Contact Info
For questions about the maps or printing please create an issue ticket here or contact Nick ([FFG Forums](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/260007-nickv2002/), or nickv2002 on the [BoardWars Discord](http://discord.me/bweu)).
